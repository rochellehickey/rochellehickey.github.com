    <p>When I edit, I like to leave comments and suggestions. I find this to be better than just "fixing" things. My goal is for you, the writer, to understand my reasons for making a change. You can reject that change or learn from it. As for my suggestions, I hope that they guide you in deciding on the best way to say a particular phrase.</p>

      <p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
      <p>I would like to recommend Julia Gilstein for a position within your company. I managed Julia while she interned as a Sales Support Assisant at A2B Tracking Solutions in 2006. Julia renewed business contracts with our clients, including numerous Fortune 500 companies. She created PowerPoint presentations detailing the costs of our products and services and sent them to clients as reminders to renew. She then followed up with each contact until the sale was complete. Julia is a highly organized individual. She managed multiple clients at a time, updating her sales progress in our client databse and regularly reporting these statuses to the team. Julia was always eager to learn and take on more responsibility, so her list of clients grew. This enthusiasm made her a pleasure to work with and a valued member of our team.</p>
      <p>I hope you will consider Julia. She would be an asset to any employer, and it is my pleasure to recommend her.</p>
      <p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,<br />

      <p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
      <p>It is my pleasure to recommend Julia Gilstein. I managed Julia while she worked as an Associate Editor in our Social Studies Department. Julia is a skilled project manager and editor who is always up for a new challenge. She successfully handled multiple print and technology projects at the same time. Julia faced this heavy workload with calm and professionalism. She understands priorities and is very attentive to quality, schedules, and budgets. Julia is also an excellent team member who is always willing to collaborate and pitch in on projects large and small. She is a hardworking and enthusiastic colleague.</p>
      <p>I hope you will consider Julia for a position within your company. I am certain that she would become a valued member of your team.</p>
