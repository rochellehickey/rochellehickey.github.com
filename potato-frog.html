    <h1>Potato Frog Protection Society</h1>
    <p>Potato products are in every grocery store nation-wide and is the fourth main staple of food for the world, the first being rice. Potatoes are grown in 44 countries and all have one thing in common; the Potato Frog. Potato Frogs are being killed by the ten of thousands each year, and as they are being destroyed, potato crops have been on the decline.</p>

        <p>Or are they? During the 2008 Presidential elections and previous elections, scammers created false websites that looked offcial with the candidates photographs, videos, and views. All the while, candidates never approved these sites. Scammers get you to these sites by having a web address that is similar, or one letter different from the real website. Once you are on one of these sites they can send more scam to your computer or when you go to donate to the candidate, they take your money and your credit card information. During the Presidential elections of 2004, thousands of dollars that were donated were never recovered because they went to scammers who knew how to make a website look real enough that you, or someone you know, would trust.</p>
        <p>I <a href="img/potato-frog-process-book.pdf">created the Potato Frog Protection Society</a> to bring about awareness on how easliy people can be fooled into believing something only because it is designed.</p>
