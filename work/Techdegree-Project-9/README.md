# Techdegree Project 9

## Run SASS

Open a tab in Terminal, change directory to the root of the project, and run:

`sass --watch scss/main.scss css/styles.css`

This will compile your SASS files to CSS and watch them for changes.

## Run local server

Open a new tab in Terminal (don't use the one running SASS), change directory to the root of your project, and run:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`

You can now access the project locally in your browser by typing http://localhost:8080 into your browser's URL bar.
