    <p>Welcome!</p>
    <p>There have been some major changes since rochellefontainedesign.com was created in 2008. One, the name: I got married! So along with a new name comes a new site! I’ve been a busy bee with new projects and will be unveiling my super awesome (adjectives completely necessary) updated site in early 2012. Champagne, diamonds, and cookies will fall from the heavens in celebration! (At least that is what I’m anticipating.)</p>
    <p>In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact me about a project!</p>
